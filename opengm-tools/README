This folder contains a wrapper around OpenGM's tools for approximate MAP inference

1] Install OpenGM [Tested on version OpenGM 2.3.5 http://hci.iwr.uni-heidelberg.de/opengm2/?l0=library] 
1] Make sure that h5c++ is installed and accessible on your system. 
	-This is to automatically compile and link with the requisite HDF5 libraries
2] Be sure to modify the Makefile (INCLUDES,LFLAGS) in this directory so that the include statements correspond to your installation of opengm. 
3] Copy over <path-to-opengm>/src/converter/uai2opengm to the directory here. This is necessary to convert from UAI to OpenGM 
4] Run make 
	-This should create the binary map_solver

OpenGMs file format and documentation for how their models are saved was hard to come by.
	-Unfortunately, this means that every MAP call first writes to UAI, converts to OpenGM's hdf5 format, 
	performs MAP inference and writes a simple text output, which is then read back in python.....Not ideal and inefficient
I know.....
