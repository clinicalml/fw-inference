# required package
# depending of the flag activated in cmake
# boost graph and libxml  may be required (warning! XML flag incompatible with STATIC compilation flag)
#obviosely if you tag the ilog flag 
#ilog librares will be required.

# library : gmp is required

sudo apt-get install libgmp3-dev

# if you want to cross compile toulbar2 please upload static GMP library and header file for MinGW
# at the following url : http://cs.nyu.edu/exact/core/gmp/
# location of static gmp lib for windows must be update in cmake-script/FindGmp.cmake
# by default locate is ./lib/win32/

#cmake package are also required
sudo apt-get install cmake cmake-data cmake-curses-gui

#for cross compilation under ubuntu
#the following package are required

sudo apt-get install mingw32 mingw32-binutils mingw32-runtime nsis

# for default compilation under linux please use:

mkdir build ; cd build ; cmake .. ; make package

# build directory is now you working directory 
# by default only toulbar2 package for linux distro will be generate


# cross compilation ==> compile toulbar2 under for win32 plateform

cmake .. -DWIN32=ON ; make package


# in advanced mode you can tune your compilation option using:

ccmake ..
# if ccmake not available on your system please use:
cmake -i ..

#Different compilation options are available:  RELEASE DEBUG MINSIZEREL RELWITHDEBINFO
# each option can be tuned using the [t] pad under ccmake
# or cmake -i mode

# Release ==> -O3 -NDEBUG option remove assert 
# Debug ==> -g option
# each option can be tune using the [t] pad under ccmake
# ore cmake -i mode

cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RELEASE ==> compilation in release mode
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=DEBUG  ===> compilation in debug mode

#notice: iloglue compilation not compliant with -O3 option implied by release mode
# ==> iloglue does not support release mode

# Howto generate toulbar2 source documentation
# first install the following package required 

sudo apt-get install texlive-latex-recommended  texlive-fonts-recommended doxygen 

#  for generate documentation use the following command:

cmake .. ; make doc

#howto run toublar2 validation bench
# the wall set of foo.wcsp locate in the validation directory will be run
# each instances need also a foo.ub containing upperbound 
# so for add a new test you just have to copy it int the validation directory
# rebuild makefile using cmake . or make rebuild_cache and launch the test
# ctest scan the ./validation directory recursively 
# and create a bench listing , bench option are manager first by the default
# -DDefault_test_option="my option..."  Default_test_option is a string. it  will be used if in the bench directory
#, there is no  local definition of default parameter .
# local parameter can be declare in a cmake file named test-opt.cmake
#. in other words, you can personalise toulbar testing
# in adding you own test and precise the wanted parameter : command line argument in file, timeout, regular expression
# the test-opt.cmake  are associeted to the current directory only.

make test ; # alternative command:test


# howto genearte mendelsoft

make clean ; cmake .. -DMENDELSOFT_ONLY=ON ; make package


#howto change define option in code preprocessing.
# please edit  the ./cmake-Script/define_option.cmake
# you can add or remove your own -Dfoo option in the set_properties associeted to the  target of interest 

# howto edit package description:
edit the following variable in the CMakeLists.txt located in the project root 
SET (Toulbar_PACKAGE_DESCRIPTION "...." )
SET(Toular_PACKAGE_SUMMARY "...." )

package option are include into the ./cmake-Script/package.cmake

if you want to add a new c++ file in the toulbar2 target 
please edit ./cmake-Script/source_files.cmake

#howto generate doxygene doc file
# required packages are : doxygen latex2pdf graphviz

make doc ; # => html and pdf are create in doc/dev directory

#howto generate a codeblock project file  : =>

 cmake .. -G"CodeBlocks - Unix Makefiles"

# the command produces the Toulbar2_framework.cbp file, which can be open in Code::Blocks IDE.
# obviously cmake allows to generate project file for various IDE environement (Kdevelop , eclipse ..)
# for further information please read cmake man page (cmake --help)

#Howto use eclipse for developping toulbar2  : (follow the url)

#howto compile toulbar2 under Mac OSXX ?

 mkdir build
 cd build
 cmake -G Xcode ..
# open the xcode project file generated in the build directory
# build and manage the source code in the xcode with no problem

# How to launch toulbar2 cover test
##########################
cd build;
#==> launch all test
ctest  ;
# launch only phase 1 test
ctest -R "Phase1"
#launch Phase2 on 2 processor in parallel
ctest -j=2 -R "Phase2" ;


# ./validation and ./cover are directories dedicated to toulbar2 testing

# validation Dir correspond to the phase1 : for each directory include in validation
# you can test a given command line on the instances (*.wcsp file) include in the directory
# the command line can be  overloaded in specifying the option in  the test-opt.cmake locate in the directory
# this file include 3 variables : command_line_option , test_timeout, test_regexp
# test timeout ( used for all wcsp founded in the director)
#regexp to define successfull end. =>  set (test_regexp  "Optimum: ${UB}")   for each instance
# will compare the toulbar2 output to the upper bound include in a ub file corresponding to the instances.


#cover Dir include cover test : i.e you can test several command line option for the same instances
# liste of command line option are specified in  the file cover/cover-option.cmake
# the file include :  the set of instances  ==> list instances is a double entry list"
# the current file must include:
# one set named "instances"  (including the list of the array of option "each element include into
# $instance set  allow to declare an set of option corresponding to the given element"
# example if the set instances contain only : foo.wcsp  you must define a second set named foo.wcsp where you will"
# define the list of option ( each element of the second list "foo.wcsp will be used for create a unit test"
# on foo.wcsp with option declare on each tuple of the foo.wcsp (set)
