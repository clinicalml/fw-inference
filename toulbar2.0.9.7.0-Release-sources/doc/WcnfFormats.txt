MaxSAT-2007: Benchmarks and Solver Requirements
Updates

This document lists the requirements that benchmarks and solvers must conform to. These requirements may evolve slightly over time. You are invited to check the content of this page regularly.
Input format

The input file must be read from the file given in parameter. For example:

./mysolver <input_file_name>

Max-SAT input format

The input file format for Max-SAT will be in DIMACS format:

c
c comments Max-SAT
c
p cnf 3 4
1 -2 0
-1 2 -3 0
-3 2 0
1 3 0

    * The file can start with comments, that is lines beginning with the character 'c'.
    * Right after the comments, there is the line "p cnf nbvar nbclauses" indicating that the instance is in CNF format; nbvar is the number of a variables appearing in the file; nbclauses is the exact number of clauses contained in the file.
    * Then the clauses follow. Each clause is a sequence of distinct non-null numbers between -nbvar and nbvar ending with 0 on the same line. Positive numbers denote the corresponding variables. Negative numbers denote the negations of the corresponding variables.

Weighted Max-SAT input format

In Weighted Max-SAT, the parameters line is "p wcnf nbvar nbclauses". The weights of each clause will be identified by the first integer in each clause line. The weight of each clause is an integer greater than or equal to 1, and smaller than 231.

Example of Weighted Max-SAT formula:

c
c comments Weighted Max-SAT
c
p wcnf 3 4
10 1 -2 0
3 -1 2 -3 0
8 -3 2 0
5 1 3 0

Partial Max-SAT input format

In Partial Max-SAT, the parameters line is "p wcnf nbvar nbclauses top". We associate a weight with each clause, wich is the first integer in the clause. Weigths must be greater than or equal to 1, and smaller than 231. Hard clauses have weigth top and soft clauses have weigth 1. We assure that top is a weight always greater than the sum of the weights of violated soft clauses.

Example of Partial Max-SAT formula:

c
c comments Partial Max-SAT
c
p wcnf 4 5 15
15 1 -2 4 0
15 -1 -2 3 0
1 -2 -4 0
1 -3 2 0
1 1 3 0

Weigthed Partial Max-SAT input format

In Weigthed Partial Max-SAT, the parameters line is "p wcnf nbvar nbclauses top". We associate a weight with each clause, wich is the first integer in the clause. Weigths must be greater than or equal to 1, and smaller than 231. Hard clauses have weigth top and soft clauses have a weigth smaller than top. We assure that top is a weight always greater than the sum of the weights of violated soft clauses.

Example of Weigthed Partial Max-SAT formula:

c
c comments Weigthed Partial Max-SAT
c
p wcnf 4 5 16
16 1 -2 4 0
16 -1 -2 3 0
8 -2 -4 0
4 -3 2 0
3 1 3 0
